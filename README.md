# Big Data DDos prediction

## Team
- Name: BLUE DATA
- Students: Mario Blauensteiner, Stefan Diener
- University: St. Gallen
- Course: Big Data Analytics

## Goal
The following project has the aim to predict if a web traffic access to a website is an DDoS attack or a normal user. Also, we used different appraoches to handle this big data in a more efficient way.

## Dataset
We used a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/devendra416/ddos-datasets), which has a size of 6.33 GB, 84 columns and 12,794,626 rows. 

## Implementation
To predict the DDoS attack, we used the following classification machine learning models:
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- XG Boost
- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- Logistic Regression
